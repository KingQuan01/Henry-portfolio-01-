        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I am a dedicated web developer with experience in building responsive
          and user-friendly websites. I enjoy learning new technologies and
          improving my skills. My journey in web development began when I
          created my first website in high school, and since then, I have been
          passionate about coding and design.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the years, I have worked on various projects, ranging from simple
          landing pages to complex web applications. I believe in the importance
          of clean code and maintainable design, and I strive to implement best
          practices in all my work.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to my technical skills, I am a strong communicator and
          enjoy collaborating with others to bring ideas to life. I am always
          looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow as a developer.

        <h2>Hobbies and Interests</h2>
        <p>
          When I'm not coding, I enjoy hiking, photography, and exploring new
          technologies. I love to travel and experience different cultures,
          which often inspires my work.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm also an avid reader and enjoy books on technology, design, and
          personal development. I believe that continuous learning is key to
          staying relevant in the fast-paced tech industry.
